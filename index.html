    <h1>Welcome to Oxford University</h1>
    <p>Explore world-class education, groundbreaking research, and a rich history at Oxford University.</p>
    <p>The University of Oxford is a collegiate research university in Oxford, England. There is evidence of teaching as early as 1096.</p>
    <p>The university is made up of thirty-nine semi-autonomous constituent colleges, four permanent private halls, and a range of academic departments which are organised into four divisions.</p>
    <p>All the colleges are self-governing institutions within the university, each controlling its own membership and with its own internal structure and activities. All students are members of a college.</p>
    <p> It does not have a main campus, and its buildings and facilities are scattered throughout the city centre. Undergraduate teaching at Oxford consists of lectures, small-group tutorials at the colleges and halls, seminars, laboratory work and occasionally further tutorials provided by the central university faculties and departments. Postgraduate teaching is provided in a predominantly centralised fashion.</p>
